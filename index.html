<p>Contributing to open source is a great learning experience but,</p>

<ul>
<li>Docs aren't always clear</li>
<li>How one should go about contributing isn't obvious </li>
<li>Codebases are gigantic and intimidating...etc.</li>
</ul><p>See: </p>

<a name="vim-could-be-better" class="anchor" href="#vim-could-be-better"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vim could be better</h3>

<p>Vim is awesome. But: </p>

<ul>
<li>The learning curve is ridiculous</li>
<li>Plugins could be better (Install a plugin to manage your plugins? What?)</li>
<li>It has tons of features that most people don't use (refer to point 1)

</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="lets-make-both-better" class="anchor" href="#lets-make-both-better"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Let's make both better!</h3>

<p>No, let's not rewrite Vim.
Instead, let's make a text editor that: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is modal like vim</li>
<li>Is highly configurable like Vim</li>
<li>Understands a subset of commonly used vim motions (dw, m[buffer name], etc).</li>
<li>Has a plugin system that behaves like "real" code (none of that API/scripting stuff)</li>
</ul><p>Doing so will give people a project that they can both use day to day as well as contribute to (something that I wish I had when I first started with open source). </p>

<a name="progress-so-far" class="anchor" href="#progress-so-far"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Progress so far</h3>

<p>Some basic vim commands have been implemented
<img src="https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/demo.gif" alt="movement gif"></p>

<p>Development of plugin prototypes have begun and here is an quick and dirty implementation of control p
<img src="https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/plugin.gif" alt="plugin gif"></p>

<p>Code before plugin injection:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/Before.png" alt="before"></p>

<p>Code after plugin injection:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/After.png" alt="after"></p>

<p>Plugins are injected directly into the codebase (via a loading script). That way plugins have access to every single state variable in the program. Code specific to each plugin can be segmented into it's own module to prevent naming collisions.</p>

<a name="so-what-next" class="anchor" href="#so-what-next"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what next?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately shim isn't ready to be used yet (I've been working at this for the past week or so and the RSI is starting to kick in).</p>

<p>There is still tons of work to be done! Create a proper unit testing suite, create proper plugin loading logic, tons of design decisions to be made... yada yada. As of right now the repo is just slightly under two thousand lines and there is tons of foundational stuff that needs to be done so contributing should be extremely straightforward.</p>

<p>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:swong15@illinois.edu">swong15@illinois.edu</a> and let me know what you think! Or even better, take a look at the issues and send a pull request if you find something that interests you (I'll have the issues list updated soon). </p>
