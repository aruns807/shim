{"name":"Shim","tagline":"A vim inspired text editor","body":"### What is shim?\r\nIt's a text editor that: \r\n* Is modal like vim\r\n* Is highly configurable like Vim\r\n* Understands a subset of commonly used vim motions (dw, m[buffer name], etc).\r\n* Has a plugin system that behaves like \"real\" code (none of that API/scripting stuff)\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n* Contributing to open source is hard and I want to make something that is hopefully less intimidating for people to contribute to.\r\n* I highly doubt most people use the full feature set of Vim and creating something that is easier learn / extend could be extremely useful.\r\nDoing so will give people a project that they can both use day to day as well as contribute to (something that I wish I had when I first started with open source). \r\n\r\n### Progress so far\r\nSome basic vim commands have been implemented\r\n![movement gif](https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/demo.gif)\r\n\r\nDevelopment of plugin prototypes have begun and here is an quick and dirty implementation of control p\r\n![plugin gif](https://raw.github.com/swong15/shim/master/src/images/plugin.gif)\r\n\r\n### So what next?\r\nUnfortunately shim isn't ready to be used yet \r\n\r\nThere is still tons of work to be done ! Create a proper unit testing suite, create proper plugin loading logic, tons of design decisions to be made... yada yada. As of right now the repo is just slightly under two thousand lines and there is tons of foundational stuff (everything is tentative and can be changed if desired) that needs to be done so contributing should be extremely straightforward.\r\n\r\nSend me an email at swong15@illinois.edu and let me know what you think! Or even better, take a look at the issues and send a pull request if you find something that interests you (I'll have the issues list updated soon).\r\n\r\nI've created an thread to discuss feature/design considerations: https://github.com/swong15/shim/issues/3","google":"UA-49483905-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
