{"name":"Shim","tagline":"A vim inspired text editor with a different agenda","body":"### Contributing to open source is hard.\r\n* Docs aren't always clear\r\n* How one should go about solving a problem isn't obvious \r\n* Codebases are gigantic and intimidating...etc.\r\n\r\nSee: \r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=sw:[good%20first%20bug]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Vim could be better\r\nVim is awesome. But: \r\n* The learning curve is ridiculous\r\n* Plugins could be better (Install a plugin to manage your plugins? What?)\r\n* It has tons of features that I doubt many people use (see point 1)\r\n![Vim is hard](http://i.imgur.com/VOe71EA.png)\r\n\r\n### Let's make both better!\r\nNo, let's not rewrite Vim.\r\nInstead, let's make a text editor that: \r\n* Is highly configurable like Vim\r\n* Is modal like vim\r\n* Understands a subset of commonly used vim motions (dw, m[buffer name], etc).\r\n* Has a plugin system that behaves like \"real\" code (none of that API/scripting stuff)\r\n\r\nDoing so will give people a project that they can both use day to day as well as contribute to (something that I wish I had when I first started with open source). \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
