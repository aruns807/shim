### Shim - A vim inspired text editor

To install dependencies:
```
pip install pygments
```

Right now syntax highlighting is done with pygments(whether or not we ultimately use this can be decided later).

To run:

Add src/shim.py to your path and run it with

```
shim filename
```

On first run shim generates metadata files so the first run should take a little longer depending upon directory size.
